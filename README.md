# Hangman_Game
Hangman is an interactive, classic word-guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a polished design and engaging user experience with multiple categories (Fruits, Countries, Animals), and additional features such as random hints. The goal is to save the "hangman" by guessing the word before running out of attempts.
